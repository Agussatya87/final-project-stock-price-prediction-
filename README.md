We want to create a machine learning model to predict stock price trends, to find out the movement of stock price fluctuations.

Our ideal outcomes is the desired result is to be able to predict with high accuracy in a certain period. making it easier for investors to make decisions in investing strategically in stocks to potentially get positive returns, so as to minimize financial risk. In this case, the desired results are focused on the accuracy of the model's predictions in determining the direction of movement of stock price trends. In some cases where the model is likely to underpredict, users may want to ensure that the model's performance is relatively consistent over time. If the model has large fluctuations in performance, this could be a signal that the model is unstable. Due to the unstable movement of stock prices in this model, there is a possibility that inconsistent predictions may occur.

This machine learning model can predict the closing price movement of a stock for a given period of time. This prediction is given in the form of numerical values and graphs that reflect the price predicted by the model. And the addition of moving average charts is only to support the investor's analysis. Closing price predictions are made immediately after the close of each day's stock market that is linked to yahoo finance. The prediction results are used in the ongoing investment process, where the previous day's prediction results become one of the requirements for the next day's closing price prediction.

If we don't use ML to predict stock price movements, we can use simple technical analysis that can be used by novice traders, such as determining support and resistance and looking at technical indicators such as moving average and relative strength index (RSI) to give buy or sell signals. Or with fundamental analysis by looking at the company's financial statements.
